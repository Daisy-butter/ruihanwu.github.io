RoboBrain 2.0 integrates visual-language-action reasoning through multimodal world models.  
It enables agents to learn interactive tasks grounded in perception and embodiment.

### Key Components
- **Embodied Perception** — world-anchored representations
- **Language Grounding** — connecting linguistic and spatial reasoning
- **Action Policy** — optimized through embodied simulation
